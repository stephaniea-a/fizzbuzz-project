# fizzbuzz-project

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to write tests, using rspec, in order to write functions for the game fizzbuzz. This game consists of printing out numbers 1 to 100. If a number is divisible by 3 then 'Fizz' is printed, if divisible by 5 'Buzz' is printed and if divisible by both then 'Fizzbuzz' is printed instead of the number.

## Implementation
This was created in a class which was instanstiated in order to be used in our rspec test.
